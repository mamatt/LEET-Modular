This is the 3DPCB version of LEET modular. 

This model has 3Dprinted parts with channels for copper wires replace the need for a PCB.
Note that this version is a bit trickier to assemble than the PCB version, especially since the final unit is difficult to correct once the wires from the different units are soldered together. Also note that this is an early version using single turn potentiometers making it difficult to tune with precision. I have sketched on a version with multi turn potentiometers, it will be slightly thicker like the PCB version. Let me know if this is of interest - it will hopefully encourage me to update the 3d model ;)
