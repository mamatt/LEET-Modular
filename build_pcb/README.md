This is the PCB version of LEET modular - upload the gerber file to the PCB manufacturer, while waiting for the order you can print the optional 3D parts that support the build, protects the components and have integrated snaps to attach modules together. 


There is a routing error in my PCB design, so three wires need to be adjusted in this version. I used the 3D printed adapter and copper wire instead of a pin header, allowing me to compensate for the error.

I have also included a 3D printed front panel as inspiration. The front panel can of course be replaced with a traditional aluminum panel, FR4/PCB or even a PCB with aluminum core...
